# üìà Apple Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting the closing stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. Utilizing historical stock data from the `all_stocks_5yr.csv` dataset, it begins with visualizing trends in open/close prices and trading volume for several major tech companies including AAPL, AMD, FB, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, EBAY, CSCO, and IBM. The data is preprocessed by converting date columns, filtering for the target company, and normalizing the closing prices using `MinMaxScaler`. A sequence-based dataset is then created for training the LSTM model, which features two stacked LSTM layers, dense layers, and dropout for regularization.

The model is trained on 95% of the Apple stock dataset and evaluated on the remaining data using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics. Finally, the actual and predicted stock prices are plotted to visually assess the model‚Äôs performance, showcasing how deep learning can be applied for time series forecasting in financial markets.
